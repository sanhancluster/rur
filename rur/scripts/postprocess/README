This module does post-process for new snapshots.
For example, when you get a new snapshot of ramses simulation,
you want to build galaxy/halo catalog or merger tree.

This routine tells you what you need and how to do.

- Galaxy for NewCluster
`$ python3 run_prepare.py /storage7/NewCluster --galaxy`

- Halo for NewCluster
`$ python3 run_prepare.py /storage7/NewCluster`
